# Math-Birthdays
Mathbirthdays.com is a site that wants to help people celebrate their special "math birthdays".
A "math birthday" is a date that is 10^n days after the day they were born. On your first math
birthday you are 10 days old, and on your second you are 100 days old, and on your third you
are 1000 days old, which is almost 3 years old, etc.

The mathbirthdays.com site is very simple. There is a way to select your birth date, and the
page shows your next upcoming math birthday.

## Technical aspects
The site is a single html file with no assets. All css and javascript is inline or
hosted in publicly accessible locations elsewhere (like jquery or other frameworks).
It uses Bootstrap as a support framework for styling. The site is responsive as well.
